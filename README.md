There are two different ways to start a screeps server.
* [without a world](#create-the-world)
* [with a world already created](#running-the-server)

## Create the world
If you do not have an existing server directory, just start the Docker container with the command line argument `init`, and everything gets done for you. The `LOCAL_UID` environment variable ensures that the files that are created in the mounted volume have the correct owner set. You can enter any valid (host) uid here. When omitted the default uid is `9001`.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}/screeps:/screeps -e LOCAL_UID=$(id -u) -e STEAM_KEY=YOUR_STEAM_KEY_HERE qnimbus/docker-screeps init
```
Now it's all set to run the Screeps server.

## Running the server
Make sure you have a server directory (from aprevious installations or by running the 'init' command above).

You can use 'docker-compose' to start the screeps server, create the screeps_net bridged network and start the redis and mongodb instances.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

If you want to start each container manually follow the steps below.

1. Make sure you are in the server directory
2. [Create the custom bridged network](#creating-network)
3. [Start mongo & redis containers](#mongo-redis)
4. Run the server
```bash
docker run --rm -it --name screeps --network screeps_net -v ${PWD}/screeps:/screeps -p 21025:21025 -p 21026:21026 -d -e LOCAL_UID=$(id -u) qnimbus/docker-screeps
```

## Additional setup steps

### Build your own container

To build your own (customized) container locally, run the following command:

```bash
docker build . -t qnimbus/docker-screeps
```

### Getting Steam API key

Navigate to [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and generate or copy your Steam API key.

### <a name="creating-network"></a>Creating a bridged network for MongoDB and Redis

You need to add the screeps, mongo and redis containers to a custom bridged network so the container names are resolvable via DNS on the individual containers. If you do not have a separate custom bridged network you can create one as follows:

```bash
docker network create --attachable -d "bridge" --subnet 172.28.0.0/16 screeps_net
```

*Note: The subnet can be changed to your individual needs as well as the network name ('screeps_net')*

### Starting and running MongoDB and Redis

```bash
docker run --rm --name redis --network screeps_net -d -v redis-volume:/data redis
```

```bash
docker run --rm --name mongo --network screeps_net -d -v mongo-volume:/data/db mongo
```

### Creating a password

In order to push your code to your private server you need a password (using `screepsmod-auth`) for your user. You can configure a password by pointing your browser at 
[http://127.0.0.1:21025/authmod/password/](http://127.0.0.1:21025/authmod/password/) or by typing `setPassword('your_password')` into the screeps console when logged in on the screeps client.

## Managing the server

### Mods

Mods can be installed by running:
```bash
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/screeps -e LOCAL_UID=$(id -u) qnimbus/docker-screeps yarn add screepsmod-auth
```
### CLI

The CLI can be accessed by running:

```bash
docker exec -it screeps npx screeps cli
```

### Useful CLI commands

To reset server state & data:

```bash
system.resetAllData()
```


## Stopping and starting the server
Stop:
```docker stop screeps```  
Start:
```docker start screeps```

## Updating

1. Stop the server:
  ```docker stop screeps```
2. Remove the server:
  ```docker rm screeps```
3. Remove current image 
  ```docker rmi qnimbus/docker-screeps```
4. Follow [Running the server](#running-the-server)

## Troubleshooting

When running the docker commands from a Windows Git Bash shell (MSYS) you may need to prepend the `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` environment variable to the commands, like so:

```bash
 MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/screeps -e LOCAL_UID=$(id -u) -e STEAM_KEY=YOUR_STEAM_KEY_HERE qnimbus/docker-screeps init
```
